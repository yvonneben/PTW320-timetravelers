										In recent years, indoor plants have surged in popularity, becoming a staple presence in many people's homes. They serve as beautiful natural decor, bringing the outdoors to people’s tables, windowsills, and any corner they can go. They bring calm to busy environments as well as fresh smells. Some have closer bonds with their plants, treating them like pets or children–obsessed with caring for them, even collecting them. In a sense, they have become one of the most valuable indoor commodities.<br><br>
										But what is there in taking care of plants?
										After all, plants are living things and rely on outside factors and resources to survive, and when plants are taken indoors, they need extra attention. As a plant owner, it is your responsibility to nourish them, give them life. They are not something you can leave alone and expect to be fine. Having plants requires work.<br><br>
										That’s why you should be prepared when buying and taking care of houseplants. Below, you’ll find some helpful tips regarding how to properly give your plants the light, water, soil, atmosphere, and protection they need to thrive. Though the tips are only the essential foundational steps, they will set you up to be an established plant owner.

											<h3>Light</h3>
										<br>
										<p>
											Light is the source of a plant’s energy, allowing it to grow and flourish. That’s why for indoor plants, it’s as important as ever to give them the light that they need.
											<br> 
											<ul> 
												<li>Before buying a houseplant, consider the lighting of the room it will go in. Some plants, like Cacti, need more than 6 hours of sunlight to survive and putting them in low light rooms will stop them from flourishing.</li>
												<li>When buying that plant, make sure it would have a place in the house that would give it the light it needs. Depending on the plant you have, it may need high light (6+ hours of light), medium light (4-6 hours), or low light (4 or less hours). </li>
												<li> In the case that proper natural light isn’t available, certain artificial lights, like LED’s and Incandescent lights, can also be used to give plants light. Click <a href="https://www.lampsplus.com/ideas-and-advice/grow-lights-for-indoor-plants-_2d00_-getting-started/" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about how and which artificial lights can be used. </li>
												<li>To encourage even growth, rotate the position of your plants every once in a while. This allows every side of the plant to face the sun.</li>

										<h3>Water</h3>
										<br>
										<p>
											Like humans, plants rely on water for life. Although it might seem like a simple task, watering plants properly can keep plants healthier. So here are some tips on how to properly water your plants!
											<br>
											<ul>
												<li>While many people worry about underwatering their plants, overwatering is actually the greater issue! The tendency to be generous can lead to overwatered plants that start falling apart.</li>
												<li>Before watering your plants, make sure the soil is dry. Stick a finger about an inch into the soil. If it is wet or even damp, hold off from watering. Check a day or two later using the same method, and if it’s dry, then you may water.</li>
												<li>Err on the dry side when watering. Water until the entire top layer of the soil is wet or until water starts dripping out of the bottom drainage holes of the plant’s pot/tray.</li>
												<li> It’s best to use room-temperature water, as water that is too cold or too hot can shock your plants’ roots! Though not necessary, filtered water is also preferable, as it reduces the amount of unnecessary minerals going into the plant.</li>
											</ul>

										<h3>Soil</h3>
										<br>
										<p>
											Most house plants come with their own pot and soil, which should good enough for your plant. There may come a time where your plant may need to be repotted—or when you could input your own soil—and it’s good to be prepared for that.
											<br>
											<ul>
												<li>The same type of soil usually can be used for many types of plants. There are some plants, like cacti and orchids, that have their own soil mixes. You can click <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/ai/best-potting-soil-for-indoor-plants/9ba683603be9fa5395fab9017fc6e16e" target="_blank">here</a> to see what kind of soils are best for various plant types. </li>
												<li>Fertilizer can also be added to soil and be another way for plants to get the nutrients they need. If you decide to use fertilizer, apply about a teaspoon (unless otherwise stated) every two weeks and only during the growing season (spring and summer). In depth info on different fertilizers and their effects can be found <a href="https://www.bhg.com/best-fertilizer-for-indoor-plants-6834569" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
												<li>As plants grow, they will have to be repotted into larger pots. Typically, an overgrown plant will have its roots curling around the inside of the pot or have an overgrowth of foliage; if the roots aren’t sticking out, it’s best to check them every half year to see if they need more space.</li>
												<li>When repotting, tilt the pot at an angle, brush the top layer of dirt into a container, and gently wiggle the plant out so as not to tear any roots. Then, after you’ve added some soil at the bottom of your new pot, hold your plant so that the top of your roots are below the pot’s surface and pour soil around it, packing it in so that the roots are tightly covered. You can find a visual demonstration of repotting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S21qTq6kU0Y" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
												<li>When houseplant foliage becomes two big, you can split the plant by cutting a branch or stem system off the main plant and potting it in a new pot, just as described above.</li>

										<h3>Humidity</h3>
										<br>
										<p>
											Humidity, temperature, and air moisture are all important factors for healthy plant growth, especially when you are trying to raise plants from different geographic regions.
											<br>
											<ul>
												<li>For houseplants that are tropical or require high humidity, try placing them in rooms where humidity is at 50% or higher. If that is not possible, place a humidifier next to your plant or spray it a few times a day with a mist spray bottle.  For more tips on humidity for plants, and to see which plants need high humidity, click <a href="https://www.ourhouseplants.com/guides/humidity" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
												<li>Plants do best when their surrounding temperature is at least 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep that in mind so that plants aren’t too exposed to cold winds or scorching temperatures for too long.</li>
												<li>Airflow is also crucial for healthy plants. While cold wind drafts should be avoided, make sure that the plants receive daily air circulation, whether through open windows, ceiling fans, or something similar.</li>

											<h3>Other Ways to Keep Your Plant Healthy</h3>
											<br>
											<p>
												Aside from having nutrients and proper living conditions, there are other factors to keep in mind when raising your plants.
												<br>												
												<ul>
													<li>Oftentimes, dust starts to collect on the plant’s foliage. To clean it off, you can either mist it with water from a spray bottle or wipe it off gently with a wet paper towel.</li>
													<li>Under rare circumstances, your plant could come under attack by outside forces. Sometimes, pests can start eating your plant or making their home in its pot, or your plant can catch a disease and start to die. In these cases, first isolate the plant from the rest of your indoor plants. Then, cut off the infected/infested part of the plant, and then repot the part of the plant that is healthy.</li>
													<li>Whenever dried up or wilted foliage appear on your plant, be sure to trim them off.</li>
													<li>During the winter months, make sure your plants have the warmth that they need. Plants left inby unattended rooms or by and windy windows will eventually die.</li>
												</ul>
