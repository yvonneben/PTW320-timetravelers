							</p>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="column" style="width: 50%;">
									<p style="font-size:larger;">
										<b>5: Acknowledge FIVE things you see around you.</b>  It could be a pen, a glass of water, or anything in your immediate surroundings. <br><br>

										<b>4: Acknowledge FOUR things you can touch around you.</b>  It could be your hair or the ground under your feet. Notice the texture of the four things you touch. Is it soft? Rough? Flexible or hard? <br><br>
									
										<b>3: Acknowledge THREE things you hear.</b>  This could be any external sound. You may notice the loudest sounds first, such as someone talking or a car honking.  Challenge yourself to listen to the quiet sounds that tend to be in the background unnoticed.  Notice which sounds brings you a sense of comfort or calm.  <br><br>
										
										<b>2: Acknowledge TWO things you can smell.</b>  If at first, you don’t feel like you can smell anything, simply try to sense the subtle fragrance of the air around you or of your own skin.

							<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">Body Scan Meditation</h2>
							<p style="font-size:larger;">
								<br>
								Before starting this exercise, sit in a comfortable position and take several deep breaths. Once you find your breath, go through the following steps:
							</p>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="column" style="width: 60%;">
									<ol style="font-size:larger;">
										<li><b>Get comfortable.</b> Lying down is preferable but if that's not possible, sitting comfortably is also an option.
										</li>
										<li><b>Take a few deep breaths.</b> Let your breathing slow down.  Start breathing from your belly instead of from your chest, letting your stomach expand and contract with each breath. 
										</li>
										<li><b>Bring awareness to your feet.</b> Now slowly bring your attention down to your feet. Begin observing sensations in your feet. Move your feet or wiggle your toes. If you notice pain, acknowledge it, and gently breathe through it.	
										</li>
										<li><b>Breathe into the tension.</b> Focus on any uncomfortable sensations. Visualize the tension leaving your body through your breath and evaporating into the air. 
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Scan your entire body.</b> Continue this practice with each area of your body, gradually moving up through your feet until you reach the top of your head. Notice how you feel and where you are holding your stress. Continue to breathe into any tightness, pain, or pressure you are feeling.
